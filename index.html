  <h1 style="text-align:center">Martín Costa</h1>
  <p>Yo, welcome to my website! My name is Martín Costa (see picture below). I am currently doing my masters in discrete mathematics at the University of Warwick and this is where I plan to keep a record of the work that I have done. This website is (clearly) still very much under construction though.</p>

  <p>As far as math goes, my main interests are all related to algorithms. These include (but are not limited to) the very broad areas of randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, complexity theory, graph theory, and dynamic algorithms.</p>

  <p>My research interests primarily lie in the field of dynamic algorithms. Some of the more specific problems that I am interested in are incremental cycle detection, dynamic submodular maximization, online edge coloring, and dynamic geometric set cover. I am planning on starting a PhD in theoretical computer science soon. This will be at Warwick with the Theory and Foundations (FoCS) group at the Department of Computer Science.</p>
