  <h3> About me </h3>
  <p> I am a PhD student working with the Theory and Foundations (<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/">FoCS</a>) group at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/">Warwick University Computer Science Department</a>. The main goal of my PhD will be to make progress in the area of dyanmic algorithms and my studentship is being funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (<a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/">EPSRC</a>) Doctoral Training Partnership. </p>
  <p> I received my master’s degree in discrete mathematics from the University of Warwick, where I studied a combination various types of computer science and maths. I mostly focused on theoretical computer science, studying things like complexity theory, graph theory, randomized and approximation algorithms, quantum computing, and learning theory. I also studied pure maths, and I am particularly interested in measure theory, functional analysis, and ergodic theory. </p>

  <h3> Research Interests </h3>
  <p> My research interests primarily lie in the field of dynamic algorithms. Some of the specific problems that I am interested in and have worked on are incremental cycle detection, dynamic submodular maximization, online edge coloring, and dynamic geometric set cover. I am very open to collaboration, so if anyone is interested in working with me, please get in touch via email. </p>
